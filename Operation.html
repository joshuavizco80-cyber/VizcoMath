  <p>This slide introduces how new functions can be formed by combining two existing functions through operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It points out that these operations can only be performed if the input value lies within the domain of both functions involved. Special care is needed when dividing functions to avoid dividing by zero.
    In this example, two functions are represented using arrows between input and output values. The task is to calculate the results of combining these functions using addition, subtraction, and multiplication at specific input values. This visual method helps learners see how function values are assigned and how operations can be applied step by step.
    This slide shows the solution to the previous example using the mapping diagram. Each required operation is performed by identifying the correct output values from the diagram for each input, then applying the requested operation. The results are shown clearly to reinforce how function operations work.
    This example presents two functions defined by sets of ordered pairs, where each input is paired with an output. The task is to evaluate combinations of these functions, such as their difference or applying one after the other, at given values. This setup helps learners apply function operations using list-based definitions rather than diagrams.

  <p>Here, the previous question using ordered pairs is solved. The needed function values are located from the list, then the operations are carried out accordingly. The example highlights how to work with concrete data to evaluate combined functions, even when no formulas are given.
    This slide introduces a more advanced example involving algebraic expressions. Two functions are defined using variable-based rules, and the goal is to apply operations like subtraction and composition. The student is asked to evaluate the result for specific input values or expressions.
    This slide walks through solving part of the previous example using step-by-step substitutions into the given function rules. It carefully performs operations using algebraic simplification. The focus is on understanding how to plug one function into another or apply standard operations while following proper algebraic methods.
    The solution continues by solving the rest of the given tasks, showing how to evaluate combined functions at specific values. This includes finding outputs after applying a function to a result from another function, highlighting the concept of function composition and the importance of order in applying functions.

  <p>This slide introduces the formal idea of composition of functions. It explains that composition involves applying one function to the result of another. In other words, the output of the inner function becomes the input for the outer function. It also reminds the reader that this only works if the inner function’s output is valid for the outer function.
    In this example, two functions are defined, one as a list of ordered pairs and the other as a table. The student is asked to perform function composition, using outputs from one to find the correct inputs for the next. It’s a great way to visualize how function composition works when not using equations.
    This slide shows the process of solving the composition problems from the previous example. It involves tracing values from the first function and using them as inputs into the second. This reinforces how the output of one function flows into the other, and helps learners see how tables and lists can work in composition.
    Here, a new example combines a table-defined function with a graph. The student is asked to evaluate the composition of two functions at a certain point. This involves first using the table to get one value, and then finding the corresponding value from the graph based on that result. It blends two formats of function representation.

  <p>This slide provides the solution to the previous example. It walks through how to interpret the table, use the output to find a point on the graph, and then retrieve the final result. The example demonstrates how different function formats can be used together when evaluating compositions.
    A new example is introduced using algebraic expressions. The functions are given using formulas, and the task is to compute function compositions at various inputs. A key question is posed to test understanding of the order of operations in function composition.
    This slide begins solving the composition example using algebra. It shows how to substitute one function into another using variable expressions, and how to simplify the result. A remark is included to emphasize that the order in which functions are composed matters.
    The final slide completes the algebraic solution for the composition example. It evaluates the composed functions at certain values and checks if reversing the composition gives the same result. It concludes by pointing out clearly that changing the order of function composition usually changes the result, which is an important concept in function analysis.
