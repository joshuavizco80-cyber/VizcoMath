  <p>The image presents an overview of different types of functions and their graphs:

Functions and Their Graphs: The image introduces the concept of functions and their corresponding graphs.

Constant Function: A constant function is represented by the equation 𝑓
(𝑥)=𝑎
f(x)=a, where 𝑎
a is a non-zero constant. The graph of this function is a horizontal line, and it shows that for all values of 𝑥x, the function always returns the same value 𝑎 a. The domain is all real numbers (𝑅R), and the range is the constant value [𝑎][a].

Zero Function: The zero function is given by 𝑓(𝑥)=0
f(x)=0. It is a special case of a constant function where the output is always zero. Its graph is a horizontal line at 𝑦=0
y=0, with the domain being all real numbers (𝑅R) and the range being the single value 
{0}{0}.

Linear Function: A linear function follows the equation 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑚𝑥+b
f(x)=mx+b, where 𝑚
m is the slope and 𝑏
b is the y-intercept. The graph of a linear function is a straight line. The slope
m determines the steepness of the line, and the y-intercept 𝑏
b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis. The domain of a linear function is all real numbers (𝑅R), and its range is also all real numbers (𝑅R).

This explanation provides a basic understanding of constant, zero, and linear functions with their respective graphs and domains/ranges.</p>

  <p>This image continues the explanation of different types of functions, each with its characteristics and graphs:

Quadratic Function: A quadratic function has the form 𝑓(𝑥)=a𝑥2+𝑏𝑥+𝑐f(x)=ax2+bx+c,whe≠

=0, and a, 𝑏
b, and 𝑐
c are constants. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola. If 
𝑎>0
a>0, the parabola opens upwards; if 
𝑎<0
a<0, it opens downwards. The vertex of the parabola is given by the formula 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑎(𝑥−ℎ)2+𝑘
f(x)=a(x−h)2
+k, where (ℎ,𝑘)
(h,k) are the coordinates of the vertex. The domain of a quadratic function is all real numbers (𝑅R), and its range depends on the direction in which the parabola opens.

Radical Function: A radical function is defined by a radical expression, such as 𝑓(𝑥=𝑥f(x)=x
	​

. The graph of a simple radical function, like the square root function, is shown as a curve that starts from the origin and increases slowly. The domain of a radical function depends on the index of the radical. For square roots, the domain includes all values of 𝑥
x that make the expression under the root non-negative.

Split or Piecewise-Defined Function: A piecewise function is defined by different expressions for different parts of the domain. For example, the function 𝑓(𝑥)={𝑥2}
	for 𝑥<02𝑥	for 𝑥≥0f(x)={x22x}	​
for x<0
for x≥0
	​

 uses different formulas based on the value of 𝑥
x. The graph of a piecewise function often has different segments, which may be continuous or discontinuous, depending on the expressions involved.

Absolute Value Function: An absolute value function is defined as 𝑓(x)=∣𝑥∣
f(x)=∣x∣, where 
∣𝑥∣
∣x∣ represents the absolute value of 𝑥
x. The graph of this function is a V-shaped curve, where the function behaves differently for positive and negative values of 𝑥
x. The absolute value function can be written in piecewise form as:

𝑓(𝑥)={𝑥
	if 𝑥0

−𝑥
	if x<0f(x)={x−x
	​

if x≥0
if x<0
	​


The domain of an absolute value function is all real numbers, and its range is non-negative values.

These explanations provide insights into quadratic, radical, piecewise, and absolute value functions, with graphs showing their respective shapes and behaviors.</p>

  <p>The image explains the Greatest Integer Function, also known as the Floor Function.

A greatest integer function is defined as 𝑓(𝑥)=⌊𝑥⌋
f(x)=⌊x⌋, where ⌊𝑥⌋
⌊x⌋ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to 
𝑥
x. In other words, for any real number 𝑥
x, the greatest integer function rounds x
x down to the nearest whole number.

The notation ⌊𝑥}=𝑛
⌊x⌋=n means that 𝑛
n is the largest integer such that 𝑛≤𝑥<𝑛+1n≤x<n+1.

The function is often referred to as the floor function, and the "floor" refers to the idea of rounding down to the nearest integer.

For example:
⌊4.5⌋=4⌊4.5⌋=4⌊−4.5⌋=−5{−4.5⌋=−5⌊3.9⌋=3⌊3.9⌋=3⌊−2.3⌋=−3⌊−2.3⌋=−3

The graph of the greatest integer function shows horizontal steps at each integer value, with each step corresponding to a range of 
𝑥
x-values between consecutive integers.</p>
